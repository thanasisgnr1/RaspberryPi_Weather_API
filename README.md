# RaspberryPi Weather API

I just made my first Raspberry Pi Python Project with OpenWeatherMap API

We use OpenWeather API https://openweathermap.org/api (must make a new account https://openweathermap.org/home/sign_up ) and generate an API Key that you have to implement at the project. 

The city name that we use is: 255274 and it stands for Piraeus Greece. You can find your preferred city name http://bulk.openweathermap.org/sample/ at city.list.json.gz   

We use Tkinter 

We inform about the time, temperature, the selected city, current time, the image of the current weather status and the most important, if jacket is needed. 

This project is running better at 3.5 inces RaspberryPi LCD Screen
