# RaspberryPi_Weather_API

I just made my first Raspberry Pi Python Project with OpenWeatherMap API

We use OpenWeather API https://openweathermap.org/api (must make a new account https://openweathermap.org/home/sign_up ) and generate an API Key that you have to implement at the project. 

We use Tkinter 

This project is running better at 3.5 inces RaspberryPi LCD Screen
